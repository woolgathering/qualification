# Quals
Documents related to my quals. In each folder I'll have various Markdown files related to my readings/work that I'm doing in preparation. It's a bit unorganized right but now as I create more, I'll organize more cleanly.

I figure this approach could be useful so each of you can see what I'm doing as it relates to my other committee members. It also keeps things in one place and avoid searching through email chains to find documents.
