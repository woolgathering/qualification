# Judgment and Purpose
Joel Fisher, 1987. excerpts from "Judgment and Purpose" in _The Success of Failure_

## Summary

Fisher begins by explaining how failure fits into our thinking (in the West, at least). The Greeks admired perfection but when the Christians came along, they didn't admonish the imperfect; instead, they accepted the weak, the sick, the imperfect as they were. With this in mind, Fisher proposes _anaprokopology_ (from the Greek _ano_, not, and _prokopi_, success) as a general term to designate the area of existence in which success is not achieved or is irrelevant.

Fisher goes on to discuss how we are often made to believe failure is more common than it is. He uses the example of a textbook on obstetrics he read before his son was born, describing all the ways the birth could go wrong but hardly mentioning the most likely outcome of a living, healthy child. However, manifest failure is relatively uncommon, as we can often anticipate failure from a distance and the path leading to it can then be abandoned. This leads Fisher to the idea of the "unfinished work".

As an example, Fisher uses Michaelango's unfinished sculptures. Although incomplete, they are generally considered masterpieces (`perhaps due to the fact that they're Michaelango's?`).

The unfinished is no longer viewed with negative prejudice or suspended judgment as they were in the past (`citation needed...`). If this is true, then it seems, Fisher suggests, that a work is "somehow complete at every point in its development."

Fisher goes on to suggest that many inevitable failures are abandoned only to be finished later (`Warhol's Empire comes to mind`). But then the question arises, "How can one expect to recognize failure at a time when one doesn't know or recognize one's goals?" The clarity of a work is evolutionary and that clarity sometimes does not ever appear. The artist is left with nagging suspicions and, in the case of Picasso's _Les Demoiselles d'Avignon_, kept rolled up under the bed, out of sight from both the artist and the world but [`interestingly`] not discarded. (`This makes me think of Cage's 4'33" which was completed many years before it was premiered. In that case, however, it was Rauchenberg's White Paintings that prompted Cage to premiere the work.`)

Genuine failure cannot be made intentionally, Fisher points out. It comes by "indirectly... almost as if it creates itself." An intentional failure is nothing but an "unwholesome, nihilistic form of success". For him, it comes down to intention and as he sees it, intention marks the way of art in the 20th century. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, failure draws distinction (`between what is somewhat unclear`). Failure is the line of the frontier, the edge of the acceptable and/or possible, fraught with possibilities where certainty and insecurity mix.

As to the forms of failure, Fisher first brings up the "most extreme form" wherein the standard for success is so high and unlikely to be achieved that success becomes "almost fictional". Interestinly, though, he notes that despite almost guarenteed failure in these circumstances, they do not discourage the "passionate impulse to strive toward he highest ideals." This type of failure he compares to the Upanishad formula for distinguishing the sacred, _neti neti_ (not this, not that). He calls this search for the impossible objective the most profound and pure manifestation of anapokopological form. (`Makes me think of more than one Xenakis work... In another context attitude might be called 'idealism' or 'wishful thinking'`)

Another form of failure he suggests occurs when a kind of "rightness" of a work of art is not achieved. This can be internal to the work or to its external relationship to the rest of the world. He uses Keith Sonnier abandonment of a series of works when he saw the conditions in which the children producing the world would be subjected to while producing it (`what the work was is not said`). Further, Jackie Winsor abandoned a piece when it needed a hidden supporting pipe, believing it to undermine the integrity of the work as a visual piece.

On the topic of integrity, Fisher offers up an example of a Picasso painting a collector attempted to sell but was told was a fake. Angry, the collector took the work directly to Picasso himself from whom he had purchased the painting some years earlier. Picasso examined the painting and said, "I'm sorry. They are right. It is a fake." The collector, rightly astonished, explained that it couldn't be as he had purchased the work from Picasso himself. Picasso replied, "Well, I can make fake Picassos just as well as anyone else."

A work can also fail in terms of timing. The artwork itself may be integrious but its exposition in the world may make it unintentionally invisible. A sudden obstacle may rear its head (`as technological works are wont to do`) and cause a work to fail. He suggests that more and more we find things that work in a photograph or reproduction but not in reality, and that when proportions are incorrect, it leads to thresholds beyond which is error (`Spinal Tap's stonehenge, although conceptually dubious, was a clear failure of proportion`). To this end, Fisher suggests that things often fail in amount, too this or too that, and that the "kinds of extremes we find objectionable are gauges of our attitudes and values." This might be better said the other way around: that the kinds of extremes we can tolerate are gauges of our attitudes and values.

At the end, Fisher discusses the idea of mindfulness of failure. At times, we are unable to see it, whatever the reason, and especially when the failure taints our image of what we expect of ourselves and others. He notes that it is generally felt that we 'own' failures while success is often shared; failure, by its nature in our thinking, is more private. Moreover, a failure is never so serious as when it is unrecognized and that one might say an unacknowledged failure doesn't exist.

Towards the end, Fisher uses the example of inventors who, one might imagine, have a very high rate of failure and that their attitude protects within society the freedom to persevere. He quotes a Silicon Valley executive: "We tell our people to make at least ten mistakes a day. If you're not making ten mistakes a day, you're not trying hard enough." This, in a sense, turns the way we think about failure on its head. Fisher then suggests that the scientific method, in which hypotheses are made and the whole idea is to find data that refutes it, is a middle ground where success is hoped for but failure is searched for. This, however, is a long way from seeing failure as positive. Nonetheless, the act of reaching toward the perfect state endures and has what he calls _intentional existence_. The goals, reached or not, exist ephemerally in the work (`This is basically made manifest in Erasure, wherein there is a perfect state which no one can actually experience while the piece is running`). Fisher suggests that there might be more genuine content in failure than success and that the failure of big ideas is more impressive than the success of little ones.


## Reaction
I might even venture to say that Michaelango's unfinished works are more beautiful (perhaps not as _impressive_, though), than his finished works.
This is of course related to my ramblings on Exposure. Here the illusion of form is broken, we see the medium for what it is and that adds new or different metaphorical dimensionality to the work. It can say something more about the content (I'm thinking specifically of the _Awakening Slave_. What a wonderful image!). So it seems my ramblings on exposure are not without precedent.

I very much like this idea of failure as the frontier. I think, though, that for a failure to be a frontier, it must be a particular kind of failure. After all, the ways of failure are many and not all are created equal (strange to say...). Nonetheless, the frontier is something I'm attracted to or perhaps what is beyond the frontier, the _unknown_.
I'm reminded of a somewhat famous passage from Eric Shipton's _Blank on the Map_: "As I studied the maps, one thing about them captured my imagination ... Across this blank space was written one challenging word, 'Unexplored'." Perhaps most poignant is his use of the adjective _challenging_, as if it were a call to action, to go beyond the frontier, beyond failure and success.


What would be really wonderful and, I imagine, provoke all sorts of questions, is to try to create a series of works that are "fake" pieces attributed to you (I take the Picasso example as a starting point). What would it mean, or take, to create a "fake" version of your own work, where authorship can be directly attributed to you? Is this possible? What does it mean for a work to be "fake"? I suppose one solution would be to outsource the labor; that is, go on Amazon Turk, send a worker a bunch of your pieces and ask them to create another piece using your ideas. Even if legally one could have all the rights to the piece, would I really be the author?

__10 mistakes a day.__ This is basically the way I try to work. I've been told twice in my life about working on the edge, first by my father and second by Charlie Wilmoth, one of my first composition mentors. My father suggested that when I was racing motorcycles that if I wasn't almost crashing, almost losing control of the machine, then I wasn't going fast enough. Likewise, Charlie suggest that while working on a piece one should almost not know what was going on. It should exist at the very threshold of understanding, the very threshold of control. I've taken this to heart in more than one way.
