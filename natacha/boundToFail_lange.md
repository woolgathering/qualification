# Bound to Fail
Christy Lange

## Summary
Lange essentially documents the history of failure (futility of process, functionlessness, Sisyphean repetition, etc) as artwork. She goes further and discussses how this fits into these works or these artists' larger practice.

### Pertinent examples:

__Bruce Nauman__<br/>
_Bouncing Two Balls between the Floor and Ceiling with Changing Rhythms_ 1967-68 <br/>
_Failing to Levitate in the Studio_ 1966 <br/>

__Douglas Huebler__ <br/>
_Variable Piece, No. 70_ (1971-97). An attempt to photograph everyone alive.

__Bas Jan Ader__ <br/>
_I'm Too Sad to Tell You__ 1971 <br/>
_In Search of the Miraculous_ 1975. Ended (?) in the artists' disappearance at sea. <br/>

__Jonathan Monk__ <br/>
_Searching for the Centre of a Sheet of Paper (White on Black/Black on White)_ 2003, 16mm, 20 second loops. A reference to Huebler's _A Point Located in the Exact Centre of an 81/2 x 11 Xerox paper_. Lange argues that it is an experience with the frustration of trying to live up to a pre-existing model or expectation for art. Monk: "The piece is done with the understanding that you can't do it." <br/>


### Quotes
_"Conceptual art is not necessarily logical. The logic of a piece or series of pieces as a device that is used at times only to be ruined."_ (Sol LeWitt)

 _"[Jonathan] Monk pinipoints the possibilties for failure hiding underneath the surface of these older systems and brings it out by translating it into aesthetic objects."_

_"What [these artists] tap into is not the cold rationalism of conceptual artworks, but the cracks in their objective systems, or the vague, fleeting appearance of insecurity or doubt."_

_"There is something fragile and fallible about taking on a project that can't be finished, performing an act that can't succeed, or creating a work that will never be seen."_

_"Art is not work precisely because it doesn't have to 'work'. The act of failure or the failed act of art making is promising and productive."_
