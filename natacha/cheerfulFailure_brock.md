# Cheerful and Heroic Failure
Bazon Brock, 2004

## Summary

Brock traces "failure as form" in contemporary art, pointing to specific works and discussing how they fit into this project. He begins by discussing Karl Popper and his principle of 'falsifiability' and applies relates this idea to the experimentation in the arts of the 20th century. Essentially, Brock argues that "artists wanted to check [the preordained/historical/accepted] understanding of art by experimenting."

He goes on to argue that the artists treated failure of an artwork to conform to a normative concept of art as a "precondition for making the theme something new and unknown." Brock further ties this to Hitler as an artist, legitimizing himself "through his experience of failure as both a citizen and an artist... The need to be radical arose from the experience of failure." Therefore, Brock argues, Hitler could be convinced that he had changed the world more radically with his failure than all his contemporaries.

Further, Brock argues that "youthful subcultures" (`in my mind, punk`) have used failure for self-justification.



### Quotes

_"The modern artist sees the success of his oeuvre in its faulure to verify a preordained understanding of art according to academic rules through works; for it would in no way be up to him as an individual if he had to confirm only normative aesthetics or art theory through his work."_

_"The philosophy of failure as a form of perfection became total."_


## Reaction-Thoughts
It seems what Brock is doing is showing that definition-(of success)-by-failure has quite the history, even beyond 20th century art.
