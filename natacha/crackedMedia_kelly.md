# Cracked Media: The Sound of Malfunction
Caleb Kelly, 2009

## Summary
The focus of this article is the vinyl work of Czech artist Milan Knížák but also elaborates on his work with the theme of "destruction".

At the start of the excert, Kelly suggests that the use of desruction in artwork is partly, at least, accelerated by "the obsolescense of the technology" in that something damaged (or surpassed) it is devalued and that object is now ripe for remaking via destruction (`Kelly continually uses the phrase "extreme destruction" which I find somewhat puzzling...`). Knížák began working with vinyl records mostly out of financial dificulty: he owned few records and became bored of them after they were the only things to listen to. He then began to play them fast, slow, scratch them, etc. This enentually resulted in Knížák working a variety of techniques to disrub the playing of the record, including tape over the grooves, burning, cutting up and sticking different records together, etc. The work _Destroyed Music_, includes a work that is created from four different vinyl discs broken and glued back together.

See [Broken Music Composition, 1979](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88ONydyRX7c).

The rest of the exerpt goes on to describe the development of Knížák's records and detail the techniques employed. Knížák ultimately ended up creating unplayable records (thinking of them as a sort of sculpture) after a long period of trying to always make them playable. Among the more interesting works were some created in the late 1980's in which he applied paint to the grooves, rendering them unplayable but, however, there still remains the potential of music hidden under the paint. (`Reminds me of Robert Barry's Closed Gallery`)

## Reaction

I'm not entirely sure when Christian Marclay produced his re-pasted records but I'm fairly certain that this predates them. What's interesting about Marclay, however, is that the destruction of records took a different turn in his work _Record Without a Cover_ when it is the artifacts of transport and of playing that became part of the work (this is directly related to the work of Walead Beshty).
