# Dewey, Pragmatism, Technology
Larry A Hickman, 2017.
_The Oxford Handbook of Dewey_

## Summary

The paper looks at Dewey's account of technology through many of his works as it does not appear in a single volume, rather sporadically in his output. The author sets out to answer the following questions:

  - Since Dewey's treatment of technology is not concentrated in any one of his publications, is it possible to distill his ideas into a coherent account that is more accessible than the one he left us?
  - In what sense was his project pragmatic?
  - How does his project differ from other 20th century approaches? (Namely, Heidegger and the Frankfurt School)
  - How does his project relate to some of the main 21st century vectors and debates within the philosophy of technology?
  - How radical was Dewey's pragmatic account of technology?

### Distilling Dewey

Dewey's understanding of technology was that it was essentially inquiry into the tools and techniques of inquiry. That is, __"technology [for Dewey] is systematic inquiry into the invention, development, and production of tools and other artifacts (conceptual as well as material) as they are cognitively deployed to raw materials and intermediate stock parts (conceptual as well as material) with a view to the resolution of indeterminate or problematic situations."__ Hickman suggests that it is the _logos_ of _technē_, in the general sense of _technē_. More broadly, it is inquiry into the tools, methods, and materials of specific disciplines (i.e. biology, geology, art, etc).

Hickman describes Dewey's account of technology as "the warp on which the weft of disciplinary inquiries into tools and techniques are woven." Dewey, moreover, thought that disciplinary inquiries into tools and techniuqes are active accross a variety of disciplines that are not necessary technological in the sense that that word is commonly understood (law, historiography, the arts, religion).

### Dewey's Account of Technology as Pragmatic

First, defining Dewey's pragmatism (he denied the label but we all know how that went): his understanding was based on the idea that the meaning of a conception lies in its conceivable practical effects. Specifically, "meanings are not representational but fluid and contextual: they emerge within processes of inquiry as the result as a result of the interplay between means and ends that allows them to 'breed' new meanings." Hickman quotes Dewey: "Meaning, fixed as essence in a term of discourse, may be imaginatively administered and manipulated, experimented with." This process of using meaning effectively "breeds" new meanings. Dewey further distinguished between what is experimental and what is empirical, the experiment being, "the art of conducting a sequence of observations in which natural conditions are intentionally altered and controlled in ways which will disclose, discover, natural subject-matters which would not otherwise have been noted." (`This clearly is a take on scientific experimentalism, naturally, since his project of technology is about inquiry, as opposed to what we think of artistic experimentalism.`)
