# Dewey, Pragmatism, Technology
Larry A Hickman, 2017.
_The Oxford Handbook of Dewey_

## Summary

The paper looks at Dewey's account of technology through many of his works as it does not appear in a single volume, rather sporadically in his output. The author sets out to answer the following questions:

  - Since Dewey's treatment of technology is not concentrated in any one of his publications, is it possible to distill his ideas into a coherent account that is more accessible than the one he left us?
  - In what sense was his project pragmatic?
  - How does his project differ from other 20th century approaches? (Namely, Heidegger and the Frankfurt School)
  - How does his project relate to some of the main 21st century vectors and debates within the philosophy of technology?
  - How radical was Dewey's pragmatic account of technology?

### Distilling Dewey

Dewey's understanding of technology was that it was essentially inquiry into the tools and techniques of inquiry. That is, __"technology [for Dewey] is systematic inquiry into the invention, development, and production of tools and other artifacts (conceptual as well as material) as they are cognitively deployed to raw materials and intermediate stock parts (conceptual as well as material) with a view to the resolution of indeterminate or problematic situations."__ Hickman suggests that it is the _logos_ of _technē_, in the general sense of _technē_. More broadly, it is inquiry into the tools, methods, and materials of specific disciplines (i.e. biology, geology, art, etc).

Hickman describes Dewey's account of technology as "the warp on which the weft of disciplinary inquiries into tools and techniques are woven." Dewey, moreover, thought that disciplinary inquiries into tools and techniuqes are active accross a variety of disciplines that are not necessary technological in the sense that that word is commonly understood (law, historiography, the arts, religion).

### Dewey's Account of Technology as Pragmatic

First, defining Dewey's pragmatism (he denied the label but we all know how that went): his understanding was based on the idea that the meaning of a conception lies in its conceivable practical effects. Specifically, "meanings are not representational but fluid and contextual: they emerge within processes of inquiry as the result as a result of the interplay between means and ends that allows them to 'breed' new meanings." Hickman quotes Dewey: "Meaning, fixed as essence in a term of discourse, may be imaginatively administered and manipulated, experimented with." This process of using meaning effectively "breeds" new meanings. Dewey further distinguished between what is experimental and what is empirical, the experiment being, "the art of conducting a sequence of observations in which natural conditions are intentionally altered and controlled in ways which will disclose, discover, natural subject-matters which would not otherwise have been noted." (`This clearly is a take on scientific experimentalism, naturally, since his project of technology is about inquiry, as opposed to what we think of artistic experimentalism.`)

__Functionalism__ <br/>
Dewey's understanding of functionalism as it relates to pragmatism is best understood by the way it relates to "process" and "structure".
  - _Process_: the manifestation of energy in a change. The relatively dynamic factor.
  - _Structure_: the arrangement of energies in a relatively static or enduring form. The relatively static factor.
  - _Function_: the consequences that give meaning or significance to process or structure. The "ends" maintained and subserved (phase of use and purpose).

Dewey _functionalizes_ the difference between material and conceptual tools as their function in practice determines them as instruments and not their structural features. (Hickman goes aside and notes Dewey's view on logical objects [i.e. numbers, classes, etc]. He viewed them as _tools of inference_ in the same sense as plows in a field, as opposed to physical, psychological, or metaphysical objects.)

__Instrumentalism__<br/>
His understanding of instrumentalism as it relates to pragmatism is that "means are treated as both instruments and as intermediate ends of inquiry."
  - _Instruments_: "Laws" of nature/science are not treated as universal nor particular but rather as _universalizable_ in the sense that instruments can be used in appropriately relevant contexts for particular ends.
  - _Intermediate Ends_: Aims ("ends-in-view") are both ends of inquiry and instrumental for further inquiry (`a never ending sequence of inquiry, it seems`).

### Knowing as a Mode of Technology

Dewey specifically says that knowledge as a form of technology does not mean that its subject matter and products are related or similar to the technologies exhibited in the production of goods and services (technology as material). Dewey charactarized knowing as a mode of technology has two phases:
  1. "[K]nowledge is, first, a form of technology in the methods it employs in producing more knowledge and improving its own methods..."
  2. "[Knowledge] is _capable_ of being a technology in human social guidance of technologies now called such but whose human and social consequences are left a matter of pulling and hauling of conflicting customs and institutions which are hardly touched by effective use of the method of intelligence at work." (`?????`)


__(1)__ Knowledge is technology in that knowledge produces more knowledge _systematically_ and in ways that are self-corrective. Looking at it this way, it is not identical to the methods of the sciences and engineering since it involves both the tools of inquiry itself and is informed by inquiry into non-scientific fields. At its root is systematic inquiry into the tools, materials, and techniques of any particular discipline. __(2)__ "Knowledge is technology as an art in its 'wider human and moral sense' of tools of inquiry used and developed." (`I don't really follow what this means`).

Dewey rejects the dystopian view of technology as alienating, fails in authenticity, or forgets Being that was put forth by Heidegger and some other neo-Marxist critical theorists. Unlike Heidegger, he does not look backward from the existence of tools and artifacts to considerations of their possibility but rather "forward in ways that engage human concerns." Technology, for Dewey, is neither a thing, organization, or system. Rejecting instrumental rationality as a method, Dewey argues that it provides tools for enhanced communication and liberation from tradition and custom.




## Reaction/Thoughts

This appeals to me for several reasons the first of which is that Dewey, naturally, does not treat "technology" as a set of material objects and thinks of it far more abstractly than I think many of us (at least those of us in the computer-world) tend to think about it. Technology is a tool to be used for inquiry, in my case, mostly artistic (?) inquiry, not necessarily and end in itself, although according to his understanding of instrumentalism that could conceivably be argued. But maybe that's where I'm seeing the difference: technology, as commonly understood to refer to computational machines or electronics, ought not to be an end of an artistic project in the way technology can be an end. So if we're talking about that (artistic project), we're not talking about technology but art. If we go into an artistic project and end up talking about technology, there seems to lie the problem, for me, at least, since the means of the project aren't really the point.
