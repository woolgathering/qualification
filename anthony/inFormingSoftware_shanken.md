# In Forming _Software_
Edward Shanken, year unknown

## Summary
The article's concern is with a Jack Burnham curated show _Software_ at the Jewish Museum in NYC in 1970. Shanken is primarily concerned with situating the concept of the show in general into Burnham's art thought. Specifically, the show worked to demonstrate the semiotic similarity between art and nonart as information processing systems and was predicated on the idea of "software" as a metaphor for art (conceptual art, the ephemeral stuff from which art finds its meaning). Burnham thoguht of software (as metaphor) as analogous to artistic principles. To this end, he took Duchamp's _Large Glass_ as a starting point (and even recreated its structure in the physical layout of the show).

_Software_ contained a great many artists and exhibited works that were precursors to the responsive and interactive environments found in many installation works currently (including many of my own).

Burnham (via Claude Levi-Strauss) theorized that Western art constituted a particular "mythic structure". Conceptual art, as "software", he theorized, works to expose and "lay bare" the mythic structure of art "by demystifying it and revealing its internal logic". He illustrated these ideas in his essay "Alice's Head" in which he used the Cheshire Cat's grin as a symbol for the relationship between the art-idea and the art-object. It suggests that the grin without a cat is akin to a work of conceptual art that is devoid of all the traditional material constituents of art. It is the concept laid bare sans the material. Burnham described _Software_ as "an attempt to produce aesthetic sensations without the intervening 'object,' in fact, to exacerbate the conflict or sense of aesthetic tension by placing works in mundane, non-art formats." By applying pressure to the disjunctions between the socially programmed modalities of art and nonart (social software), he hoped to "lay bare" the mythic structure of Western art. Socially programmed responses to art are brought to bear on nonart and visa versa.

### Three Artists
#### Les Levine
Les Levine's contribution to _Software_ was with three works including _Systems Burn-Off X Residual Software_. In that work, one thousand copies of thirty-one photographs Levine had taken of _Earth Words_ were randomly distributed about the gallery floor, covered with jello, some stuck to the wall and the rest were for sale. Levine considered information as carried by media (photographs, video, etc) to be just as potent (if not more so) than the actual object itself; in this case, the show _Earth Works_: "The fact that we can confront them mentally through electronics is sufficient for us to know that they exist..." _Systems Burn-Off_ was an artwork that produced information about the information produced and diseminated by the media about art objects. The critique here is that art objects (hardware) become converted by the media to information about [an] art[work] (software). Perhaps most importantly (according to me, at least), Levine says, the particular visual (or material) manifestation of an artwork as an object is secondary to the expression of an idea that becomes reality by simulating it.

#### Hans Haacke
Haacke's jumping off point was Burnham's idea of time in art as expressed in "Real-Time Systems", that in art as in computing, there exist two time schemes: real-time and ideal-time. In ideal-time, the contemplation of aesthetic beauty occurs outside the temporal contingencies of value (in theoretical isolation) wheareas in real-time, "value accrues on the basis of an immediate, interactive, and necessarily contingent exchange of information."

One of his works in _Software_, _News_, consisted of continuously printed rolls of paper delivering real-time information about local, national, and international events. As it accumulated on the floor, it became an aesthetic object in ideal-time (in temporal isolation).

Haacke also stressed the importance of the artist using whatever means necessary to "respond systematically to social exigencies and and expanding information field."

`The artist's business requires his involvement with practically everything... The total scope of information he receives every day is of concern.`

#### Joseph Kosuth
Kosuth's work consisted of a series of six propositions which acted as the "software", instructions to the mind of the viewer.

`The art consists of my action of placing this activity (investigation) in an art context (i.e. art as idea as idea).`

The works asks the viewers to take a phenomenological approach to processing aesthetic information (examining the processing of information while processing information). The semantic meaning and material value are not embedded in art objects, institutions, or individuals. Rather, they are abstracted in the production, manipulation, and distribution of signs.

### Conclusion
Burnham thought that conceptual art fed off the "logical structure of art itself", explicitly identifying the codes that define the mythic structure and appropriated them as motifs, signifiers, and thus demystifying the protocols by which meaning and value has traditionally been constructed in art.

Burnham eventually became disullisioned with the role of emerging technology in art, losing faith in its ability to contribute meaningfully to to the signifying system he saw as the mythic structure in Western art. "Technology in art, for Burnham, ultimately was meaningful only to the extent that it contributed to stripping away signifiers to reveal the mythic structure of art."

## Reaction
This idea of abstracting the computing notions of _software_ (the stuff/information/ideas that actually make the art) and _hardware_ (the stuff/physical material that art is made _from_) is quite potent. The focus isn't technology as such but rather uses technology not as technology but as a concept.

What I find particularly interesting in many of these works is not necessarily the fact that they use technology nor the how they use technology (hardware), but rather that they use technology as a metaphor for art (software). The material of art is less critical than that which actually constitutes the art which, in the case of Burnham, is the ephemeral non-material part of art. This is very much related to my thinking about art and technology in general; not necessarily the specific ideas but the idea of focusing _not_ on technology but using it as a tool (in whatever form that may take; literal, figurative, or metaphorical).
